The only disadvantage of using Priority Queues are that the enqueue and dequeue operations are slow and have a time complexity of O(log n).
Let there be 8, 9, 6, 7, 10, 1, 11, 5, 3, 4, 2 products in the baskets of the customers waiting in a single cash register in a market. Assuming that it takes 3 seconds for the cashier to scan each product, find the transaction completion times for each customer in the Queue (in the FIFO structure) and the average transaction completion time of the customers for this cash register (you can neglect the time for transactions such as payment).
